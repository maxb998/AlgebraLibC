# Basic Algebra Lib

This is a basic C project that I wrote for myself in order to practice and learn how to use AVX instructions and improve my knowledge about performance oriented programming.
At this time the code allows only to compute some basic operations between two dimensional matrices.


In order build the executable for debugging purposes use 
``` sh
make build
```
Or if it's necessary to verify performances build with
``` sh
make build MODE=exec
```
